# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based sorting algorithm visualizer with a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. The project features several sorting algorithms, including:

- **Selection Sort**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Heap Sort**

The GUI displays a list of numbers as vertical bars, which are sorted using the selected algorithm. The sorting process is visualized in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: See how different sorting algorithms work in real-time.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Choose from multiple sorting algorithms to visualize.
- **Interactive GUI**: Generate new data and start sorting through a user-friendly interface.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (usually included with Python)
- `matplotlib` (for GUI and visualizations)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository :

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhiraman-S-Nair/Python-Concepts.git

2. Navigate to the project directory :

   ```bash
   cd repository-name

3. Install any additional dependencies if needed :

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   
4. Run the application :

   ```bash
   python sorting_visualizer.py


### Usage

1. **Generate Data :** Click the "Generate Data" button to create a new list of numbers.
   
2. **Select Algorithm :** Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
   
3. **Start Sorting :** Click the "Start Sorting" button to visualize the sorting process.
